			<p>The Norwegian Forest Cat is notable for his long, thick, beautiful coat and large size. The head has an inverted triangle shape,
 pointed at the chin and then widening on each side up toward the medium to large ears, which are heavily tufted.
 Large, almond-shaped eyes are green, gold or copper, although white cats may have blue eyes or odd eyes (one blue eye and one eye of another color). 
The moderately long body looks powerful, with its broad chest and heavily muscled thighs. Large round paws have tufts of fur between the toes. 
The bushy tail is as long as the body.</p>
